# Letterboxd-Film-Scraping
Scraps films from the Letterboxd "Films" page, then checks if they are Narrative Feature Films

It works by scraping the names, release years, and TMDB IDs of films from the Letterboxd Films page. The film's runtime and count of reviews are scraped from Letterbxd's HTML and checked against an assigned threshold. TMDB's API is then asked for the details for the scraped movies, and if a banned genre or keyword is detected the movie is denied and added to the blacklist for faster future sorting. If it is approved then it's added to filtered_movie_titles.csv. There is also a whitelist.csv and blacklist.csv which can be used to speed up movies that are known to be correct or incorrect. Rejected_movies.csv is used to check why movies got denied, in case of an error. Any movies that are not able to be found in TMDB's database are denied but added to unfiltered_denied.csv for manual sorting. Any films added to filtered_movie_titles.csv that were not already whitelisted are added to unfiltered_approved.csv for manual verification of eligibility.
