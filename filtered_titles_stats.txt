Film eligibility criteria:
-- Cannot be a short film (minimum length of 40 minutes).
-- Cannot be a television miniseries.
-- Cannot be a compilation of short serials.
-- Cannot be a documentary.
-- Cannot be a non-narrative project (paint drying for 10 hours, a timelapse of the construction of a building, abstract images, etc).
-- Cannot be a recording of a live performance (stand-up specials, recordings of live theater, concert films, etc).
-- Cannot be a television special episode, though feature film spin-offs from television shows are allowed.
-- Feature film spin-offs from television shows must contain original material, not just recap or compilation of existing material.
-- Entries that have scores inflated because they share a name with a popular television show are removed, as I notice them.
